# Restaurant
High School project that lets the user create receipts from a restaurant and saves them in a text file. After deciding the name of the text file, the menu is displayed, so the user can see the descriptions of every product, select which products and how many of them the user want to add to the receipt, delete products from the receipt and edit the receipt. After the receipt is done, and the user pays the receipt, the user is given the option to start a new order, or finish the day.
This program was done in Java by me and Sofía Elena Caraza García.
